                        <p class="w3-center">The Multimedia Programming and Design Program prepared me for careers in technical industries focused on designing and programming 
                            interactive products. I gained hands-on experience working with text, graphics, sound, animation, and video. Through collaborative projects, 
                            I developed the ability to blend creative and technical skills to produce engaging digital content.</p>

                        <p class="w3-center">During my time at TCI, I gained foundational knowledge of computer networking across various business environments. 
                            This experience helped me develop skills in supporting, installing, and designing information systems. I also learned to navigate enterprise computing 
                            environments, enhancing my ability to manage network infrastructure and troubleshoot technical issues.</p>

                        <p class="w3-center">Before the college’s closure, I was introduced to programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, C++, HTML, and CSS, 
                            using Microsoft Visual Studio as my primary development environment. I explored game design and programming through platforms like Unity, 
                            Unreal Engine, and GameMaker, which allowed me to create interactive projects and games for classmates and personal enjoyment.</p>

                        <strong>🎮 Note about the games:</strong> These games were created years ago using FPS Creator for a class I was taking.
                        They were made in the style of "I Wanna Be The Guy" games, known for their <em>extreme</em> difficulty and challenging gameplay. 💀
                        Granted, there's no rock song making fun of you for dying (sorry! 🎸), and it was actually pretty hard to make this work. 
                        Yes, I know... "FPS Creator? Boy that's old isn't it." 👴 Yes, yes it is. 😂
