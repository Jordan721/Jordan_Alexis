# 🎨 Jordan Alexis - Portfolio Website

A sleek, modern portfolio built from scratch showcasing my journey as a developer. 🚀 Previous versions live in the Trail folder. 📂

## 📅 Recent Updates

### ✨ February 17, 2026
Big UX overhaul — removed accordions and hidden content across the site in favor of always-visible layouts.

- **Experience** — Replaced bento grid with a **Split Panel layout** (year/company on left, role + details on right, glowing divider line). All info visible, no expand/collapse. Filters and stats bar preserved.
- **About Me** — Replaced 6 expandable cards with a single **Tabbed Profile Card**. Click tabs to swap content. Mobile tabs scroll with a fade hint.
- **Education** — Unified into a **split-panel timeline** matching the experience section. Primary programs show progress bars and status badges, secondary programs flow seamlessly below. All details visible.
- **Tech Arsenal** — Each category now has a **unique visual identity** beyond color: Business (pills + bottom border), Data (sharp corners + stripes), Tech (angled clips + terminal bg), Tools (dashed border + shimmer), Strategic (soft glow + no border). Unique hover animations per category (lift, pulse, glitch, shake, bloom). Mobile redesigned as a **tabbed interface** replacing the old accordion.

### 🧱 February 13, 2026
Swapped horizontal timeline for a bento grid and upgraded Tech Arsenal tag filtering with hide/reflow animations.

### 🔥 February 12, 2026
