# 🌐 Jordan Alexis - Portfolio Website

A modern, interactive portfolio built from scratch showcasing my journey as a developer. Previous versions live in the Trail folder.

## 🕐 Recent Updates

### 📅 February 19, 2026
Projects section collapsible expand/collapse and new project links added.

- 📂 **Show More / Show Less** — Featured Projects now shows 3 cards by default. A toggle button expands the remaining 6 with a smooth animated reveal and a chevron that rotates on open/close.
- 🔗 **New Projects Added** — YUU Capstone Projects, YUU Workshops, and Orbit Control added to the projects grid.

### 📅 February 17, 2026
Dashboard side navigation, dark/light mode, and visual refresh.

- 🗂️ **Dashboard Side Nav** — Replaced the old floating dot nav and social sidebar with a two-panel dashboard-style sidebar. Icon rail always visible on the left (60px), expands into a full panel with profile, labeled navigation, and social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Linktree).
- 🌙 **Dark / Light Mode** — Full theme toggle in the sidebar. Preference persists via localStorage. Light mode features clean white cards, proper text hierarchy, and a polished slate background instead of just inverting dark colors.
- 📱 **Mobile Hamburger Menu** — On mobile the icon rail is hidden and replaced with a floating hamburger button (top-left). Animates into an X when the panel is open.
- 🔗 **Connect Section in Rail** — GitHub, LinkedIn, and Linktree icon links added directly to the icon rail with hover tooltips, in addition to the expanded panel.
- ✨ Big UX overhaul — removed accordions and hidden content across the site in favor of always-visible layouts.
- 💼 **Experience** — Replaced bento grid with a **Split Panel layout** (year/company on left, role + details on right, glowing divider line). Filters and stats bar preserved.
- 👤 **About Me** — Replaced 6 expandable cards with a single **Tabbed Profile Card**. Mobile tabs scroll with a fade hint.
- 🎓 **Education** — Unified into a split-panel timeline matching the experience section. Progress bars and status badges included.
- ⚙️ **Tech Arsenal** — Each category has a unique visual identity and hover animation. Mobile redesigned as a tabbed interface.
